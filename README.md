# RecipeSwipe_documentation
I developed a recipe app that allows users to discover, save, and share recipes seamlessly. Users can browse through a variety of recipes using a swipe interface, where swiping right saves a recipe for later. Additionally, users can create a personalized profile to save favorite recipes and even contribute by uploading their own. This interactive app combines recipe discovery with social sharing, providing a personalized, user-driven culinary experience.
